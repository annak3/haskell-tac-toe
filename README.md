haskell-tac-toe
===============

Tic-tac-toe (aka noughts and crosses) in Haskell.  This is a toy project for implementing game logic, IO, and memoization in a purely functional context.

haskell-tac-toe implements a min-maxing AI and supports arbitrary board sizes.


Usage
-----
`./tictactoe [size of board] [number of human players]`

e.g., to play on a 3x3 board with 2 human players:

`./tictactoe 3 2`

or to play 4x4 against the AI:

`./tictactoe 4 1`

or to spoil the movie WarGames:

`./tictactoe 3 0`
